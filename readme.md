# Spool Holder

A stand for small spools of wire or solder. The stand is easily assembled with commonly available parts and several 3D printed components.

## Required Materials

- 3x equal length sections of 10mm diameter metal tube.
- 4x M3 threaded inserts, with an additional insert for each spool.
- 4x M3 screws, with an additional screw for each spool.
- 2x `frame.stl`.
- 2x `end-cap.stl`.
- 4x `end-cap-screw.stl`.
- 1x `wire-guide.stl` for each spool.

## Construction

1. Print the required parts.
2. Insert the threaded inserts into `end-cap-screw.stl` and `wire-guide.stl` using a soldering iron or similar heat source.
3. Glue `end-cap.stl` into the ends of one of the metal tubes.
4. Glue `end-cap-screw.stl` into the ends of the other two metal tubes. These will be the bottom tubes.
5. Insert all `wire-guide.stl` on one of the bottom tubes and secure with screws.
6. Attach both bottom tubes to `frame.stl` with screws.
7. Place spools on the other tube and thread wire through `wire-guide.stl`.
